Not at all—your logic is fine.
My first version was “pandas-y” (vectorized with `.shift()`), which can feel cryptic if you don’t use it often. That’s about *style*, not your reasoning.

Here are three equivalent levels—pick the one that clicks:

### 1) Easiest to read (plain Python logic)

```python
import pandas as pd

def consecutive_available_seats(cinema: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    free = sorted(cinema.loc[cinema['free'] == 1, 'seat_id'])
    keep = []
    for i, s in enumerate(free):
        left_ok  = i > 0 and free[i-1] == s - 1
        right_ok = i < len(free) - 1 and free[i+1] == s + 1
        if left_ok or right_ok:
            keep.append(s)
    return pd.DataFrame({'seat_id': keep})
```

Reads like human logic: list free seats, keep those with a neighbor.

### 2) Still simple (set membership)

```python
def consecutive_available_seats(cinema: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    free = set(cinema.loc[cinema['free'] == 1, 'seat_id'])
    result = sorted([s for s in free if (s-1 in free) or (s+1 in free)])
    return pd.DataFrame({'seat_id': result})
```

### 3) Pandas-style (uses `.shift()` for speed on big data)

```python
def consecutive_available_seats(cinema: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df = cinema.sort_values('seat_id').copy()
    prev_free = df['free'].shift(1).fillna(0).astype(int)
    next_free = df['free'].shift(-1).fillna(0).astype(int)
    prev_adj  = (df['seat_id'] - df['seat_id'].shift(1)) == 1
    next_adj  = (df['seat_id'].shift(-1) - df['seat_id']) == 1
    mask = (df['free'] == 1) & ((prev_adj & (prev_free == 1)) | (next_adj & (next_free == 1)))
    return df.loc[mask, ['seat_id']].drop_duplicates().reset_index(drop=True)
```

If you’re learning, start with #1 or #2. When you’re comfy, #3 is just an optimized rewrite of the same idea. Your logic is absolutely enough—you’re just choosing the clearest expression of it.
