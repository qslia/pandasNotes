Excellent question 👍

Let’s look carefully at what **`value_counts()`** does and what its **default index** looks like.

---

### 🧩 Example

```python
import pandas as pd

s = pd.Series([8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6])
print(s.value_counts())
```

**Output:**

```
8    2
3    2
1    1
4    1
5    1
6    1
dtype: int64
```

### 🧠 Explanation

* `value_counts()` returns a **Series**.
* The **index** of that Series contains the **unique values** from the original column (`num` in your case).
* The **values** in the Series are the **counts** (how many times each unique value appeared).

So:

| Element   | Meaning                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Index** | The unique value from the original column (e.g., `8, 3, 1, 4, ...`) |
| **Value** | The number of occurrences of that value (e.g., `2, 2, 1, 1, ...`)   |

---

### 🧾 In your case

When you write:

```python
counts = my_numbers['num'].value_counts()
```

`counts` looks like:

```
num
8    2
3    2
1    1
4    1
5    1
6    1
dtype: int64
```

So if you do:

```python
counts.index
```

You get:

```
Int64Index([8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6], dtype='int64')
```

And if you filter:

```python
counts[counts == 1].index
```

You get:

```
Int64Index([1, 4, 5, 6], dtype='int64')
```

That’s why in the function:

```python
singles = counts[counts == 1].index
```

`singles` already holds the **numbers** that appear once — you can directly apply `max(singles)` to find the largest one.
